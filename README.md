                                                   August 31

By September 7: Implement a basic structure for Group, Coxeter Group, Classes A-D, Element (Set?).

By September 21: Build code to find the peaks of a Class A Element.

By September 28: Make a conjecture that you can then test with code.

By October 28: Write code that can at least partially test the conjecture.

Note that this schedule is necessarily vauge since a lot depends on what exactly I discover during my research. I'll fill in more detail once I know exactly what I'll need code to investigate.
